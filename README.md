# Everyday Explorer

Browser-based single-page prototype for 4–6 year olds to explore real-world challenges, earn stickers, and let parents track progress via a simple dashboard.

## Run locally
- Open `index.html` in a modern browser, or
- Serve statically (e.g., `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `npx serve .`).

## Deploy
Ready for GitHub Pages or any static host—just upload this folder.

## Structure
- `index.html`
- `css/` (base, child, parent styles)
- `js/` (data, state, ui, childFlow, parentFlow, app)
- `assets/` (if present)

Prototype for Milestone 3 of an HCI course project.
